# Floyd-Warshall-OpenMP-MPI
This repository contains a serial, a parallel (OpenMP) and a distributed (MPI) implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

## How to build
Firstly, go to `libgraph/` and run `make`.
Then, you can go to either `mpi/` or `omp/` and run `make`.

## Note
The MPI version doesn't work very well.
